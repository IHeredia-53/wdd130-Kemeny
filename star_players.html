                    He is the NBA’s all-time leading scorer in regular-season points and is also the first player in league history to surpass 50,000 combined points in regular season and playoff games. 
                    LeBron has earned multiple NBA championships, MVP awards, and All-NBA selections across two decades, maintaining elite performance well into his late 30s.

                    He holds the NBA record for the most three-pointers made in a career and was the first player to reach 4,000 career three-pointers. 
                    Curry has won multiple NBA championships and MVP awards, including the league’s first unanimous MVP. His shooting range, efficiency, and off-ball movement revolutionized modern offensive strategy and increased the league-wide emphasis on three-point shooting.
